Task decomposition

tAllTaskData - all data read in from training (or later - evaluation) (DataJsonInput)

further partitioning in FilterTasksBasedOnCriteria.kt:

==================
SAME SIZE
taskSameMatrixSize - input and output cell counts are equal

Further breakdown follows
==================
NOT SAME SIZE
taskNotSameMatrixSize - checked to see if Same and Not Same add to 400 tasks - they do.

further divided into:
---------------------
SMALLER
taskSmallerMatrixSize - there are 36 of these
strategy notes here:

BIGGER
taskBiggerMatrixSizes - there are 102 of these
strategy notes here:
---------------------

==================================
VARIOUS FOCUSED SOLUTION STATEGIES
==================================

Mirroring -
  criteria - input and output matrixes equal
  horizontal and vertical mirroring
  sub-criteria - diagonal mirroring
    matrix must be square

Rotation -
  rotate the outer ring of the matrix cw or ccw

Interesting examples of Tasks with identical cell counts:
025d127b   blocks move right - not all same amount
05f2a901   red blocks move down, right, up
25ff71a9   all blocks move down by same amount!
1e0a9b12   all blocks move down
3906de3d   red blocks move up

-----------
Translation
-----------
Rather difficult because it depends on "what" is translated.
Individual pixel movement is hard - because often it is in the
context of block movements or other larger abstract shapes.
Perhaps use the "block finder" to look for blocks in the input and
then try to identify identical blocks in the output, and look at
the translation, if any, of the various blocks.

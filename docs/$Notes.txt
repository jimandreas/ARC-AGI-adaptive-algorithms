Task decomposition

tAllTaskData - all data read in from training (or later - evaluation) (DataJsonInput)

further partitioning in FilterTasksBasedOnCriteria.kt:

==================
SAME SIZE
taskSameMatrixSize - input and output cell counts are equal

Further breakdown follows
==================
NOT SAME SIZE
taskNotSameMatrixSize - checked to see if Same and Not Same add to 400 tasks - they do.

further divided into:
---------------------
SMALLER
taskSmallerMatrixSize - there are 36 of these
strategy notes here:

BIGGER
taskBiggerMatrixSizes - there are 102 of these
strategy notes here:
---------------------

==================================
VARIOUS FOCUSED SOLUTION STATEGIES
==================================

Mirroring -
  criteria - input and output matrixes equal
  horizontal and vertical mirroring
  sub-criteria - diagonal mirroring
    matrix must be square
